Challenge                   : Predict the orbit of the James Webb space telescope with a quantum algorithm (Herman Kolden)


## General information
The jupytar notebooks were created using Qbraid Womanium module without any extra packages.

All files I edited are founde in the Challenge-Solution folder.

In the sub-folder Jupytar-Notebooks, you will find the jupytar notebooks providing full description of the solution.

There is one jupytar notebook per task:
- Task 1: HHL
- Task 2: Aplitude Encoding
- Task 3: Quantum teleportation

There also a presentation (in PDF and PPTX formats), in the main directory (Challenge-Solution), containing a short description of tasks 1, 2 and 3, plus the entire description of task 4.
